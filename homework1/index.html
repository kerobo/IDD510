		<h5>*Fake University is not associated with this article's fake university that was <strong>really</strong> fake. Fake University is fake fake. Wait - do those two cancel each other out? Hang on a minute...</h5>

		<p>Why come to Fake University? There's a number of reasons.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Voted #1 School of the Year by Unreal College Magazine in 2042</li>
			<li>Lost Worst Real School Competition in 1986</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Accidentally won in 1992. This was an error on their part, but they won't take it back.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Has been not teaching students for 136 years</li>
			<li>FREE TUITION FOR EVERY STUDENT!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Wait a tick, did you say FREE TUITION? We sure did! Here at Fake University, we only teach you absolutely nothing - so why should <em>you</em> have to pay for it? You're already paying for it by reading this page!</p>

		<h3>But how do we fund Fake University's operations?</h3>

		<table border="3" cellpadding="5">
			<thead></thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Ad space</th>
					<th>We are living in the future. Everything is digital now. Chalkboards and whiteboards are a thing of the past. Instead of tossing our outdated equipment, Fake University rents out these spaces in your classroom to advertisers. Just make sure you absorb the ad's information thoroughly during class - your professor has nothing important to say, anyway! Literally, they don't say anything. Watch the ads.</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>"Backdoor" Deals</th>
					<th>Somehow, the back half of the University was built over a highway, nearly ten miles away from the most frequented buildings on campus. Our students love using the University's front doors, because of their convenient locations, but tend to shy away from that back half. Meanwhile, drivers of cars and trucks feel that the toll prices they pay on the stretch of highway under our University are too high. We offer these drivers an alternate route at a slightly cheaper price. They still pay to pass, but don't realize that we wouldn't have made any money otherwise! Win-win.</th>
